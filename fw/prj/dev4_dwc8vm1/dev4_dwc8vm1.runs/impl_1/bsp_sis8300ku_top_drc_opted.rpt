BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer ins_payload/ins_app_top/blk_rtm.gen_dwc8vm1.ins_rtm_dwc8vm1_top/blk_rtm_io.ins_hrl_ibuf_n/IBUFCTRL_INST (in ins_payload/ins_app_top/blk_rtm.gen_dwc8vm1.ins_rtm_dwc8vm1_top/blk_rtm_io.ins_hrl_ibuf_n macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-2#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP ins_payload/ins_app_top/blk_mimo.ins_mimo/ins_iq2/ARG input ins_payload/ins_app_top/blk_mimo.ins_mimo/ins_iq2/ARG/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-2#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP ins_payload/ins_app_top/blk_mimo.ins_mimo/ins_iq2/ARG0 input ins_payload/ins_app_top/blk_mimo.ins_mimo/ins_iq2/ARG0/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-2#3 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP ins_payload/ins_app_top/blk_mimo.ins_mimo/ins_iq2/ARG0__0 input ins_payload/ins_app_top/blk_mimo.ins_mimo/ins_iq2/ARG0__0/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-2#4 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP ins_payload/ins_app_top/blk_mimo.ins_mimo/ins_iq2/ARG0__1 input ins_payload/ins_app_top/blk_mimo.ins_mimo/ins_iq2/ARG0__1/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-3#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP ins_payload/ins_app_top/blk_mimo.ins_mimo/ins_iq2/ARG output ins_payload/ins_app_top/blk_mimo.ins_mimo/ins_iq2/ARG/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-3#2 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP ins_payload/ins_app_top/blk_mimo.ins_mimo/ins_iq2/ARG__0 output ins_payload/ins_app_top/blk_mimo.ins_mimo/ins_iq2/ARG__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-3#3 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP ins_payload/ins_app_top/blk_mimo.ins_mimo/ins_iq2/ARG__1 output ins_payload/ins_app_top/blk_mimo.ins_mimo/ins_iq2/ARG__1/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-4#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP ins_payload/ins_app_top/blk_mimo.ins_mimo/ins_iq2/ARG multiplier stage ins_payload/ins_app_top/blk_mimo.ins_mimo/ins_iq2/ARG/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-4#2 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP ins_payload/ins_app_top/blk_mimo.ins_mimo/ins_iq2/ARG__0 multiplier stage ins_payload/ins_app_top/blk_mimo.ins_mimo/ins_iq2/ARG__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.

LVDS-1#1 Warning
Bidirection LVDS IOs  
The following port(s) use the LVDS I/O standard and have bi-directional differential usage. Please note that LVDS is a fixed impedance structure optimized to 100ohm differential. This is only intended to be used in point-to-point transmissions that do not have turn around timing requirements. If the intended usage is a bus structure, please use BLVDS/BLVDS_25, instead. pio_rtm_io_n[4], pio_rtm_io_p[4].
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port pio_rtm_io_n[4] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#2 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port pio_rtm_io_p[4] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>
