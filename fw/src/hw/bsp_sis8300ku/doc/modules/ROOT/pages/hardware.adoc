== Hardware Introduction

The SIS8300-KU is a 10 channel 125 MS/s digitizer with 16-bit resolution according to the MTCA.4 standard.

The central building block of the SIS8300-KU card is a Xilinx Kintex Ultrascale FPGA. It holds the 4 lane PCI Express interface and is in control of all active components.
