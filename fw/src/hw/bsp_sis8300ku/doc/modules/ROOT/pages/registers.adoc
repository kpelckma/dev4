|CLK_FREQ
|32
|8
|R
|W
|provides frequency (in Hz) of various clocks +
[0] - BSP clock (Synced to 125 Crystal) +
[1] - Output of the AD9510 (CLK05) +

|W
|Choose which ADC to configure + 
Writing 0 will choose all ADCs for writing or ADC1 for reading +
Writing 1 will choose ADC1 +
Writing 2 will choose ADC2 +
Writing 3 will choose ADC3 +
Writing 4 will choose ADC4 +
Writing 5 will choose ADC5 +
Writing 6 or 7 will choose none +


|SPI_ADC_BUSY
