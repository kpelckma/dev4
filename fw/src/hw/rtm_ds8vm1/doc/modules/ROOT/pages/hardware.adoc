The DRTM-DS8VM1 is a 8+2-channel feed through RTM for direct sampling applications combined with a high frequency single channel vector modulator. It iscompliant to the MTCA.4 standard and the Reartransition module (RTM) interface is Class A1.1 compliant.
Eight feed through channels are configured as ACcoupled and two channels are configured as DCcoupled. The signals can be interfaced to a Class A1.1 compatible AMC digitizer board. The ADC clock and RF reference input signals can be sourced externally from the front panel as well as internally from an RF-backplane. An on-board PLL/VCO can be used for ultra-low jitter clock generation.
The module features on-board power level monitors and user I2C interfaces for communication and diagnostics.
