== Known Issues

Each region is currently using the application clock. There is a plan for the future to make each region have its own clock domain.

After trigger comes to DAQ module, sampling starts 2 clock cycles later. This might be problematic for applications that need continuous data over longer periods. This is likely solved if you are using Continous Mode.
