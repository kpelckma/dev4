|Name |Register Width |Number of Elements | RO/RW | Description


|ID
|32
|1
|RO
|Hard-coded to x"5000D851"


|VERSION
|32
|1
|RO
|Shows the revision number.

|RF_PERMIT
|1
|1
|RW
|Handles interlock on the RTM side. 1 -> Drive will be allowed

|ATT_SEL
|9
|1
|RW
|Select attenuator to be set by ATT_VAL register. 1 bit per attenuator +
bit[0:7]: attenuator on ADC channel 0 to 7  +
bit[8]: vector modulator output attenuator +
e.g. to selct attenuators on ch 1 and 5 set value = 2^1 + 2^5 = 34 +

|WORD_ATT_VAL
|6
|1
|RW
|Attenuator value to set for HMC624LP4 chip +
Attenuation = (63 - value) / 2 dBm. +
Min attenuation 0 dBm: value = 63, max attenuation 31.5 dBm: value = 0 

|ATT_STATUS
|1
|1
|RO
|Shows if there is I2C Communication with any attenuators. When it is 1 there is an on-going i2c transaction.

|ADC_A
|25 (Signed)
|1
|RO
|LO Power Voltage digitized by LTC2493 (I2C Address: 0x43)

|ADC_B
|25 (Signed)
|1
|RO
|LO Channel Temperature

|ADC_C
|25 (Signed)
|1
|RO
|Reference Channel Power digitized by LTC2403 (I2C Address: 0x43)

|ADC_D
|25 (Signed)
|1
|RO
|Reference Channel temperature digitized by LTC2403 (I2C Address: 0x43)


|ADC_STATUS
|4
|1
|RO
|Shows if there is on-going I2C communication with ADC


|ADC_READ_ENA
|4
|1
|RW
|Enables periodical reading of ADC values

|DACAB
|12
|1
|RW
|Set both DACs for common mode voltave for the Vector Modulator. Writes to both In-phase and Quadrature=phase biasing of Vector Modulator. Typical value should be = 850


|DAC_STATUS
|32
|3
|RO
|Counts the number of bursts sent to AXI.4 Slave


|WORD_DAC
|12
|2
|RO
|Like the DACAB register just allows to set the common mode voltage for the Vector Modulator seaprately for In-phase and Quadrature.+
reg[0]: In-phase channel  +
reg[1]: Quadrature channel +


|EXT_INTERLOCK
|1
|1
|RO
|Monitoring the External Interlock coming from the Front Panel of the RTM +
If it is 1 that means interlock is preventing the drive +
If it is 0 that means drive is permitted. + 


|HYT271_TEMP
|14
|1
|RO
|Temperature readout from the HYT271 chip


|HYT271_HUMI
|14
|1
|RO
|Humidity readout from the HYT271 chip


|HYT271_READ_ENA
|14
|1
|RO
|Enables the periodical readout from the HYT271 chip
