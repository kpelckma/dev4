Welcome to the start page of the DWC8VM1 Module documentation. This documentation page includes information about the hardware and firmware.

The DRTM-DWC8VM1 is a combined high frequency eight channel down- and single channel upconversion RTM compliant with the MTCA.4 standard. The unit covers the L and S-band. The down-conversion offers an excellent rms amplitude and phase short-term stability of typ. <0.005% and <10fs in the range of 10Hz to 1MHz.
