== HDL Dependencies

This module does not automatically add dependent libraries and modules. 
Instead the super-project should add the necessary dependencies as the git submodule and include their the tcl scripts on the main project.tcl

This DWC8VM1 Module depends on the following modules and libraries:

* https://gitlab.msktools.desy.de/fpgafw/lib/desy_vhdl[DESY VDHL Library]

Registers are generated using https://pypi.org/project/desyrdl[DesyRDL]
